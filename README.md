A small personal website that ive been working on as of late, its in its infancy but seeing as I got the domain for free I figured that I may aswell put it to use

Built with React through Vite, which is somthing ive never tried before but the experience is good :)

Also setup a github action that on push to main it will compile it, and deploy to gh-pages, which is pretty cool. Never done that before but it works.
